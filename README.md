# fastrenewables



#### Welcome to fastrenewables

> A framework for transfer learning in the context of renewable timeseries power forecasts.

We hope this project will help you to get excelent results for limited data in renewable power forecasts.

## Install

`pip install fastrenewables`

## How to use

Currently the library is hevaily under development. Probably some corner cases are so far not considered and documentation is not yet up to date.
Hopefully, you can still make use of it.
Feel free to copy any of our proposed models!
